            An <em>axiom system</em> has two components:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A set of special words that we officially assume have no meaning. The words are
            sometimes called undefined terms, primitives or technical terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A set of statements called axioms that we assume to be true concerning the undefined
            terms.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A <em>model</em> of an axiom system is a set of meanings for the undefined terms.
            These meanings are assigned without any regard for whether the axioms become true statements about the undefined terms.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <example xmlId="example-4point">
        <p>
          Consider the following axiom system, the <em>4 point geometry</em>.  Let <em>point</em>, <em>line</em> and <em>belongs</em> be the undefined terms.  The axioms are:
          <ol>
            
            <li>
              <p>
                There are 4 points.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Given two distinct points, there is exactly one line that they both belong to.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Each line has exactly two points belonging to it.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          Then the following are models of this axiom system.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Points are letters, lines are columns, a point belongs a line if it is on the column:
              <me>
                \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
                \hline
                A &amp; A &amp; A &amp; B &amp; B &amp; C \\
                B &amp; C &amp; D &amp; C &amp; D &amp; D \\ 
                \hline  
                \end{array}
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Points are dots, segments are lines, point belongs to a line if a segment connects them:

      <p>
        We consider the following axiom system.  Let <em>point</em>, <em>line</em> and <em>belongs</em> be the undefined terms. 
      </p>

      
      <axiom xml:id="axiom-linesize">

      <axiom xml:id="axiom-existsline">
        <statement>
          <p>
            There exists at least one line.

      </axiom>

      <problem>
        <p>
          Would any model for the 4-point geometry also be a model for this axiom system?  Justify your assertion.
        </p>
      </problem>

      <problem>
        <p>
          What is the minimum number of points possible for a model of this axiom system?  Justify your assertion.

          Find a model that satisfies <xref ref = "axiom-linesize"/>, and <xref ref ="axiom-existsline"/> but not <xref ref = "axiom-notbelong"/>.

          Prove or disprove: Each point belongs to a line.

        Since such a <q>geometry</q> is fundamentally uninteresting, we add a fourth axiom.

      <axiom xml:id="axiom-twopointweak">

          Let cards be points and SETs be lines.  Does the grid you constructed in  <xref ref="activity-buildplane" />

     <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref ="axiom-existsline"/>, there is a line <m>L</m>, by <xref ref = "axiom-linesize"/>, <m>L</m> has two points,
          <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>.  So for each point <m>A</m>, there is a line containing <m>A</m>.

          Prove that every point belongs to a line.

      <problem>
        <p>
          Find a model that satisfies our axiom system in which there are two different

          Find a model that satisfies our axiom system in which there are two different

        Since this axiom system still seems flawed, we replace the fourth axiom with a stronger version.
